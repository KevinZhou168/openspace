# OpenSpace UIUC

Many students have issues finding space on campus in high-demand areas. To help students make more informed decisions, we utilize web scraping and crowdsourcing data to estimate occupancy of public spaces on campus, and display our estimates in a user-friendly map interface. Check it out at [openspace.projectcodeuiuc.org](https://openspace.projectcodeuiuc.org/).

Data is currently sourced from Campus Recreation and university libraries.
