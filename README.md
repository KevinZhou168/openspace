# OpenSpace UIUC

This project aggregates and visualizes the occupancy of public spaces on campus.

Many students have issues finding space on campus in high-demand areas.
To help students make more informed decisions, we utilize web scraping and
crowdsourcing data to estimate occupancy, and display our estimates in an
user-friendly map interface.

Data is currently sourced from Campus Recreation and university libraries.
